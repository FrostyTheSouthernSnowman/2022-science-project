# 2022-2023 School Year Science Project

This repository contains code for my 2022 (9th grade) first semester science project. I have chosen to do a project on Machine Learning/Artificial Intelligence.
The ultimate goal of this project to take the binary-search-based optimizer I derived for finding the minima of scalar valued functions (functions that take in a
single number and output a single number) and extend it to multiple dimensions. Firstly linear regression and then neural networks. The hypothesis for the project
originally was that it could get comparable results from less compute power, at least for neural networks.

## Code overview

The extra markdown files in the root directory are just to keep my self organized. The code lives inside the `code` directory. Inside the code directory, there are the
`work-in-progress` and `completed` directories. These directories contain work that is incomplete and complete, respectively. I will try to publish Medium articles
about how the code works, what it does, and how I derived any formulas/algorithms.

## Contributing

Since this is a school project, I cannot accept any contributions until I have finished and turned in everything. After the seventh of November, I will start accepting
contributions.

## Contact

You can contact me via email (yosi_frost@icloud.com) if necessary.
