# Quotes

"The cost function reduces all the various good and bad aspects of a possibly complex system down to a single number, a scalar value, which allows candidate solutions to be ranked and compared" — Page 155, Neural Smithing: Supervised Learning in Feedforward Artificial Neural Networks, 1999

"It is important, therefore, that the function faithfully represent our design goals. If we choose a poor error function and obtain unsatisfactory results, the fault is ours for badly specifying the goal of the search." — Page 155, Neural Smithing: Supervised Learning in Feedforward Artificial Neural Networks, 1999
